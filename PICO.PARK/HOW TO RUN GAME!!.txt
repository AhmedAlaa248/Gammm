First launch and sign into steam. Download "Toxikk" on steam (It's a real game). Just cancel the download immediately and you can start the game. It's an unusual bypass for the game, but it works.

Afterwards, go inside the 'PICO.PARK' folder, right click and run 'pico_park' as administrator

If you get any missing dll errors or the game isn't lauching, go inside the _Redist folder and install all 6 programs in the folder
